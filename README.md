# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid user IDs.  The original code attempts to parse a user ID from a route parameter as an integer without checking for potential errors.  This could lead to server crashes or unexpected behavior if the ID parameter is not a valid number.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code, which includes comprehensive error handling to prevent these issues.
